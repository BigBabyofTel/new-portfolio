            Iâ€™ve spent a year studying Front-End Web Development. Learning the
            basics and applying them to understand core concepts, I hope to be
            able to offer my services for individuals and businesses alike;
            Moreover, perpetually, all aspects of my life involve learning and
            growing.

            For almost a decade, I have been living in Cairo teaching in the
            British Primary School system. I have worked at 4 schools during my
            time and gained the skills of an effective teacher. Problem solving,
            collaboration, and communication are some of the critical skills
            that I have cultivated during my near decade as an Educator. These
            skills contribute to my work as a web developer.
